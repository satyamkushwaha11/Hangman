# Hangman
In this Project I made HANGMAN GAME  in python.

Hangman is a quick and easy game for at least two people that requires nothing more than paper, a pencil, and the ability to spell. 
One player, the "host," makes up a secret word, while the other player tries to guess the word by asking what letters it contains.
However, every wrong guess brings them one step closer to losing.
